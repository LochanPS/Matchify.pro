## 💰 REVENUE CALCULATIONS

### Example: 1 Tournament with 50 Registrations @ ₹500 each

```
Total Collected: 50 × ₹500 = ₹25,000

Platform Fee (5%): ₹25,000 × 5% = ₹1,250 ✅ YOU KEEP
Organizer Share (95%): ₹25,000 × 95% = ₹23,750

Organizer Payouts:
├─ 40% Payout: ₹23,750 × 40% = ₹9,500 (Pay when tournament starts)
└─ 60% Payout: ₹23,750 × 60% = ₹14,250 (Pay when tournament ends)

Your Profit: ₹1,250 per tournament
```

### Example: 10 Tournaments per Month

```
Average per tournament: ₹25,000
Total collected: 10 × ₹25,000 = ₹2,50,000

Your Platform Fees: ₹2,50,000 × 5% = ₹12,500/month ✅

Annual Projection: ₹12,500 × 12 = ₹1,50,000/year
```
